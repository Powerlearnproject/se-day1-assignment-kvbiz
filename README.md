Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a term which simply means the application of code to solve real world problems.
it is the backbone of the technology industry. Applications, websites, search engines, all were built 
by software engineers

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
So the first stage was the birth of high level programming languages like Python, essentially making coding easy for any Tom, Dick and Harry to learn
The second stage was the birth of structured programming, or object oriented programming.
Finallym came a shift im programming philososphy which promoted code collaboration, maintainability, etc.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
So the first step is always to survey, what the customer wants. Then you build the code, then you test it, deploy it and finally maintain it

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
So the waterfall method was the old-fashioned way of doing things. It was systematic, if i wanted to build a webiste for a customer, i would only involve them in the first prototyping stage. However with the agile methododly, the customer is continuosly involved in all stages. The prject progresses in sprints, which are short cycles.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
So the project manager is the mouth of the team, he/she engages stakeholders, manages risk and so on. 
The Software dveloper is the brains, so he/she does most of the coding from scratch, often the most skiiled.
Lastly, the quality assurance manager writes all the tests and criteria for the code to meet, goes to the field and comes up with  possible scenarios.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
VCS systems are for collaboraton. Github allows multiplle developers to work on he same project. At the end of the day, no man.woman is an island.
IDE's are where one does the coding like dev c++, pycharm or the popular vscode. They have in built debuggers and file handling , so coding becomes fun and easy.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers often have to deal with workplace drama, badly written code, budget and resource constraints and so on.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Well, you can write code, but its full of runtime errors. Such errors will never appear on the terminal or debugger, they are quite had to catch. So tests ensure your code works as it should.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and crafting input prompts to effectively communicate with and extract desired responses from AI models, particularly large language models like GPT.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt may be what is engineering?
A concise prompt would be, explain in simple brief points the definition of Software Engineering and its significance.
